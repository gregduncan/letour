# Le Tour
Le Tour is a demo React Native application. It has been developed to showcase some of the awesome features of React Native. Le Tour is not production ready and should be viewed as an example template.
## User experience
Le Tour contains 3 main user interfaces. Firstly a login scene with a fake authentication process (Any credentials will pass). Secondly a list view contains each stage of the 2017 Tour de France and thirdly an info scene displaying further details of the selected tour stage.

In addition a number of other scenes have been included to pad the app out.
